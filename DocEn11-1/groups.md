# Groups
 
This page displays the user groups in the Alvao system and selected parameters of their settings.
  
Options:
   
- **Command Panel**
    - **New Group** - create [new group](groups/create-group).
    - **Edit**- edit user properties and permissions. The menu contains the same commands as the blocks in the [group preview](groups/detail).
    - **Delete** - delete the selected group.
- **Groups table** - contains all Alvao groups and their selected attributes. You can [customize the table as needed](../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables).
- **Selected Group** - After selecting a group in the table, a [view](groups/detail) will appear on the right with information about the selected group, its permissions and other settings. The individual blocks of the preview display the *Edit* command to edit the group settings.
