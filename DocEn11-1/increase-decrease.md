# Increase/decrease the number of licenses
      
If you have increased/decreased your licence:
     
- Find the original license in [License Audit](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/software/license-registry) and from the local menu use [Edit](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/software/license-registry/edit/edit-license).
- On the tab [General](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/software/license-registry/edit/edit-license/general) edit the number in the **Number** field to match the new status.
- Go to the [Documents](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/software/license-registry/edit/edit-license/documents) tab and add a link to the invoice that documents the purchase.
- Save your changes using the **OK** button.
