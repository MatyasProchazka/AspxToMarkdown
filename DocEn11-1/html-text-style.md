If you use a unified corporate identity (CID) for written communication that specifies the cut and other font parameters, you can set the font as:
     
- Default font for formatted message and event text that users write in Alvao applications, see **ALVAO WebApp - Administration - Service Desk - Settings -**[General](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/service-desk/settings/general).
- For notifications that Alvao sends to users via email, see **ALVAO WebApp - Administration - Service Desk - Settings - Notifications -**[Notification Styles](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/service-desk/settings/notification-style).
