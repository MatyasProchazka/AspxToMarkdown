# Duplicate requests
      
If two or more identical requests from the same requester happen to exist on the system, you can merge these requests into one of the duplicate requests by using the [Merge Requests](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests) command. The information from the duplicate requests (logs, links to other requests and objects, trackers) is transferred into a single successor, and the other duplicate requests are permanently removed.

> [!CAUTION]
> Merging requests is an irreversible operation.

When merging requests, do the following:
      
1. On the [Requests](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests) page, select the requests you want to merge and use the **Merge Requests** command.
2. In the [merge requests](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests/request/merge-request) form, review the information you entered and edit it if necessary.
3. Confirm the form content with the **OK** button.
