This tab allows you to manage a product recognition rule by [Custom software product libraries](../../../../../../alvao-asset-management/software-management/custom-swlib).

> [!CAUTION]
> You cannot modify rules for products from the standard software library.

  
Options:
 
- **Valid rule** - enable if you want to mark a rule as valid. A valid rule is used when recognizing software products.
- **UID**- display the product identification number.
    - **...** - assign a new UID to the rule.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not change the UID number unless prompted to do so by the program.

- **Rule Order**- specify the rule order for software product recognition. A value of 0 means that the rule will be evaluated first.
    - **...** - assign the order to the rule. It will automatically add a ranking one higher than the highest ranking for another rule. This lowers the priority of the rule being edited for evaluation.
- **Date** - displays the date of the last rule edit.
- **Certified** - display the author of the rule.
- **Product** - select from the menu the product that is recognized by this rule.
    - [...](../../../software/products/product/general) - select the product in a separate window.
