# Print report templates
     
On this page you can manage [print report templates](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/customization/reports),   which typically include [transfer report templates](../../../../alvao-asset-management/documents/transfer-protocols).
     
Options:
     
- **Command Panel**
    - **Load Template** - upload a new template. Select all the files that make up the template, i.e. the 3 basic files with the rep, htm and xsl extensions and additional files, usually css, gif, png, jpg etc.
    - **Edit** - [edit](print-report-templates/edit-template) the selected template.
    - **Delete** - remove the selected template.
- **Press Report Template Table** - contains all created press report templates and their selected attributes. You can [customize the table as needed](../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables).

> [!TIP]
> If you use templates in different languages, put the abbreviation of the language in which they are written in the template names or descriptions. You can then use this to create [views](../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables/table-views) for each language you use and share them with the whole team if necessary. 

> [!TIP]
> You can restore template files from the Asset Management Console installation directory from the *Csy/ReportTemplates* folder, or from folders for other languages.
