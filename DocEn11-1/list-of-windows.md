# Index of windows and commands
     
The pages in this chapter describe the various forms, windows, and commands from Alvao applications. Directly from the applications, you can usually open them with the help button, i.e., in [ALVAO WebApp](list-of-windows/alvao-webapp) with the **?** button on the top right, in desktop applications usually with the F1 key, or with the **Help** button.
