# Property Categories
     
In the main window, there is a **Properties** tab at the top right, which displays the properties of the object currently selected in the tree. There are also a number of other views that are used to filter properties by the appropriate category. On the far left are the two default views **All** and **Custom**. Next are the default views:
     
- Basic
- Technical
- Accounting
- Location

On each view, only properties with the selected focus are maintained by default.
     
Custom views are defined in the *Property Categories* folder, which you can view in the tree by selecting **Tools - Settings** from the main menu. and on the **Display** tab, turn on the **Show hidden objects** option. After you create or delete a category in the tree, you must manually create or delete the corresponding view on the Properties tab.
      
Each child object of the *Property Category* object represents one view. The list of properties of the child object determines what properties will be listed in the corresponding view. Only the *\_\_order* property has a specific meaning - it determines the order of the view in the window. The values of the other properties have no meaning.
