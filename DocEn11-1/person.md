> [!TIP]
> 

> [!NOTE]
> The tab only displays assets that you have permission to see and that have at least one of the *Inventory Number* or *Evidence Number* properties. If you do not have any [roles in ALVAO Asset Management](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/users/groups), this tab only appears in the application if you are looking at your assets or those of your subordinates.

    - **Documents**  

  On the tab, you can see an archive of all your [transfer protocols](../../../../alvao-asset-management/documents/transfer-protocols).
  You can sign the newly issued protocols here to confirm receipt of the asset. This tab only appears on your person page.   You cannot see the documents of other users. Similarly, other users cannot see your documents. The bookmark is part of the [ALVAO Electronic Handover Forms](../../../../modules/alvao-electronic-handover-forms) module.
  
        Features:

        - **Document Table** - step through unsigned documents, i.e. documents that have the *Signed* command displayed in the *Signed* column.
  In the *Document* column, click on the link, read the document, and then in the *Signed* column, use the **Sign** command to confirm your agreement with its contents.
