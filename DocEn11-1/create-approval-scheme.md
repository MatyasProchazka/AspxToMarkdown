# New approval scheme
   
Use this form to create a new [approval schema](../../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services/processes/request-approval).
   
Options:
   
- **Name** - enter the name of the approval scheme.
- **Description** - enter a description of the approval scheme.
- **Automatically approve approver steps from previous steps** - turn on if this is a multi-step scheme in which some steps may be approved by the same people, and you do not want an approver who has already approved a request in one step to have to approve the request again in subsequent steps. These subsequent steps will then be approved automatically.
