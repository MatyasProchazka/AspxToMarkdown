# Objects
   
In this section of the [New Service](create-service) form, you can configure the content of the service menu on the [My Trust Assets](../../../search/persons/person) and [Related requests](../../../objects/object/related-tickets) pages.
   
Options:
   
- **Display on objects of the following type** - successively select the object types on whose pages you want to show the edited service in the service menu to create a new request. Enter part of the object type name in the field and then select the appropriate type from the drop-down menu. This will add the selected type to the list below the input field.
