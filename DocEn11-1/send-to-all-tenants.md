# Email message to all tenants

Use this form to [multitenant mode](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/installation/multitenant) to email the selected message to all tenant users.
   
Options:
   
- Command Panel
    - **Send** - send the message. The command has the same function as the *Send* button on the form.
- Send a message by email to all tenants:
    - **Alvao administrators only** - the message will only be sent to members of the [Administrators](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/users/groups) group of each tenant.
    - **All users** - the message will be sent to all users of each tenant.

In both cases, the message is sent only to active users, i.e. people who have filled in their username and email and whose user accounts are not hidden, blocked or deleted.
