# Data queries
     
On this page, you can manage *data queries* in Alvao. A *data query* is a custom SQL query defined by [Administrators](../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/users/groups) or [Configuration administrators](../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/users/groups). Then, designated users can view the results of the queries on the [Data queries](../data-queries) page.
      
Options:
     
- **Command Panel**
    - [New data query](data-queries/new) - create a new data query.
    - **Edit** - edit the properties of the selected data query. The menu contains the same commands as the blocks in the [selected data query panel](data-queries/data-query) on the right.
    - **Enable** - enable the selected queries. Enabled queries are visible to designated (see [Permissions](data-queries/data-query/permissions)) users on the [Data queries](../data-queries) page.
    - **Disable** - disable the selected queries. Disabled queries are not accessible by users.
    - **Delete** - permanently delete the selected queries.
    - **User view** - opens the [Data queries](../data-queries) page with the selected query on a new browser tab. Use this command to check the results of the query from the user's point of view.
- **Data query table** - contains all data queries in Alvao. You can [customize](../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables) the table as needed.
- **Selected data query** - after selecting a query in the table, the [panel](data-queries/data-query) with information about the selected data query will appear on the right.
