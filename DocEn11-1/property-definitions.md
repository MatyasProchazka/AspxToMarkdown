# Property definitions
     
On this page you can manage [property definitions](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/object-properties).
     
Options:
     
- **Command panel**
    - [New property](property-definitions/create-property) - create a new property definition.
    - **Edit** - edit the selected property definition. The menu contains the same commands as the blocks in the [Property definition](property-definitions/detail) panel.
    - **Delete** - delete selected property definitions.
- **Table** - contains all property definitions. You can [customize](../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables) as needed.
- **Selected property definition** - after selecting a record in the table, this [panel](property-definitions/detail) will appear on the right with information about the selected record.
