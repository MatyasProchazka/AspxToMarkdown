# Searching, reporting and data analysis
     
The system offers several ways to search for information. In most [tables](working-with-tables) you can search for items using the -Find command or use a filter, see [Finding values](working-with-tables/tables-searching) and [Filter](working-with-tables/tables-filtering). For easy [search for objects](searching/looking-up-objects) in the tree, use the **Edit - Find** command. More complex searches can be implemented using [queries](searching/query).
