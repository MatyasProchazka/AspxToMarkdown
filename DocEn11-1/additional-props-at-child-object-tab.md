# Display other columns (properties) on the "Child objects"
     
1. In the AM Console, go to the **Child objects** tab.
2. Right-click on the column headers and select **Show Columns** from the local menu.
3. The **Show Columns** window will appear. Select the desired columns and press the **OK** button.

Note..:
- It is possible to work with the list in the same way as with other tables -
 filter, sort, create views, etc.
- The **Icon** column is sorted according to the selected properties
- The **Categories** column shows which tabs the property is contained in.

     Similarly, columns can also be added and removed on the "Software" tab (with the organizational unit selected in the tree) in the bottom list of computers, or in the [License-and-install-overview](../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/software/license-and-install-overview) window in the bottom list of computers.
