# Print report templates
     
Print report templates define the appearance of print reports, such as [transfer reports](../../documents/transfer-protocols), registration cards, etc.
     
The template can have one of the following formats:
     
- [REP](reports/rep-modify)
- [HTML](reports/html)

You can manage the templates stored in the database in **WebApp - Administration - Asset Management** - [Print Report Templates](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/asset-management/print-report-templates).
     
You can generate and print template-based print reports in **WebApp - Objects - Object** - [Print](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/objects/object/print) and **AM Console - File** - [Print](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/asset-management/print-report-templates).
