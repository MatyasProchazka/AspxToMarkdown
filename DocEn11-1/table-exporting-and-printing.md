# Export and print table
     
Using **Analyze in MS Excel table** you can transfer the table content to MS Excel and work with it there.  
         The other option is to save the table to a CSV file or as an HTML document using the **Save As** command.  
         To print the table on paper, use the **Print** command. First, a preview is displayed on the screen from which you can save the table to **MS Word**.

> [!NOTE]
> Commands can also be placed in the **Table** submenu.
