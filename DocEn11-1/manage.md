# Manage
   
On this page you can create and edit [current news](../../../alvao-service-desk/news).
          
Options:
   
- Command Panel
    - [New message](manage/new-news) - create a new message
    - [View](current-news) - view the news in a new browser tab
    - [Edit](manage/edit-news) - edit selected news
    - [Send](manage/send-news)- send the selected message by email
        - [Send to all tenants](manage/send-to-all-tenants) - email the selected message to users of all tenants. This command is only available for messages with the [Show to all tenants](manage/new-news) option enabled.
    - **Hide to all** - hide the selected message to all users. The current date and time will be entered in the *Hide After* item in the selected message.
- Message table - contains all messages that you have the right to see or edit. By default, the following views are defined in the table:
    - **All** - all messages that you have the right to see or edit.
    - **Active** - messages that are currently being displayed to requesters
    - **Archive**- hidden messages that are no longer displayed to applicants, i.e. they have a past date set in *Hide After*.

  Customize the table [as needed](../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables).
