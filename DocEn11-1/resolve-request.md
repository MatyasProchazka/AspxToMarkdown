# Request Resolution
     
After you, as the solver, resolve the request, use the [Requests](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests) - **Resolve** command in the application. This will end the time to resolve the request according to the SLA.
     
Continue with the [solving process](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests/request) in the request.
