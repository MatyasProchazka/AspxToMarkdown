# Settings backup
 
On this tab you can backup or restore your personal settings in Alvao applications. The functionality of the commands is the same as in **ALVAO WebApp - User Menu - Settings** - [Settings Backup](../../../alvao-webapp/settings/settings-backup).

> [!CAUTION]
> Settings are backed up/restored together for all Alvao applications. Not just for the application you are backing up/restoring from.
