# Creating a copy of an object
     
You can copy objects in the usual way via the Clipboard, i.e. using **Edit - Copy** and **Edit -Paste**, or by using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V).
     
Another option is to drag the object with the mouse to another location and hold down the Shift. The same procedure is used by Windows Explorer for copying files.
     
The object is copied along with any child objects.
