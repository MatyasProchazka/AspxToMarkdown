- **Command Panel**
    - **New Process** - create [new process](process/create-process).
    - **Edit** - edit the selected process. The menu contains the same commands as the blocks in the [preview](process/detail) process.
    - **Delete** - delete the selected process.
- **Process Table** - displays the processes and their selected attributes. You can [customize](../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables) the table as needed.
- **Selected Process** - After selecting a process in the table, a [view](process/detail) will appear on the right with information about the selected process.  The *Edit* command is displayed in each block of the preview.
