# Object kind
 
In this Window you can edit or create a new [Object Type](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/node-class).

- **Object kind** - enter the name of the new object type.
- **Computer** - enable if this is a computer type. Objects of this type will have extended functionality: [HW and SW detection](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/detection), SW license allocation, etc. 

> [!CAUTION]
> This option can only be set when the object type is created and cannot be changed later.

> [!NOTE]
> Objects of type Computer draw a license to the ALVAO Asset Management product.
