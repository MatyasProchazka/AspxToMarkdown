# Securing Software Licenses
 
On this page, you can manage software license security, especially if you keep track of [licenses for multiple organizations](../../../../alvao-asset-management/software-management/licenses).
 
Options:
 
- **Command Panel**
    - **Add** - add a new [license](software-licenses-security/item) to the list.
    - **Edit** - edit the selected permission.
    - **Remove** - irreversibly remove the selected permission.
- **Permissions table** - contains all permissions of software licenses and their selected attributes. You can [customize the table as needed](../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables).
