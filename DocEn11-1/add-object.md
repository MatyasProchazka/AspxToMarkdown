# Add object
   
In this window you can select [the object](../../../../alvao-asset-management/objects-and-properties) from ALVAO Asset Management that you want to add to the selected request on the [Objects tab](../request).
   
Options:
 
- **Object** - select the object to which the request relates from the drop-down menu. By default, the menu contains the property entrusted to the Requester of the request. If you want to select a different object, type part of its name or serial, inventory or registration number in the input line. You can also specify the type of object, e.g. by typing "monitor: dell" you can search for all objects of type *Monitor* whose name starts with the string *dell*.
    - **...** - search for the object and select it in the object tree.
