# Attachments
  
The window contains a list of attachments for the selected document. It opens when you want to open an attachment [of a document](../../../../../../alvao-asset-management/documents/links-between-objects-and-documents) that has more than one. (If the document has just one attachment, the attachment will open immediately).
 
Options:
 
- **OK** - open the selected attachment.
- **Close** - close the Attachments window.
