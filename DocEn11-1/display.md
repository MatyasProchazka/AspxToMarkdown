This tab allows you to set the display in [Asset Management Console](../../../../alvao-asset-management/console).
 
Options:

- **Main Window**
    - **Minimize to icon in Windows Taskbar (next to the clock)** - enable if the program should only appear as an icon in the Windows Taskbar when minimized.
    - **Minimize window after launch** -
 turn on if the program is to run minimized in the taskbar.
- **Software tab**
    - **Display unrecognized registry entries**
 - turn on if you want the Software tab in [main window](../../../alvao-asset-management-console) AM Console to also display [detected registry entries](../../../../alvao-asset-management/software-management/software-detection)
 computers that were not [software product libraries](../../../../alvao-asset-management/software-management/custom-swlib)
 assigned to any product. These entries serve as information that the software product library needs to be updated.
- **Object Tree**
    - **Show hidden objects** - enable to show hidden objects in [object tree](../../object-tree). The option can also be turned on/off with the main menu command [Show](../../view) - Hidden Objects. If the Use permissions option in the object tree (WebApp - Administration - Asset Management - [Settings](../../../alvao-webapp/administration/asset-management/settings/general)) is disabled, the Show hidden objects option is only displayed to members of the [Asset Management administrators](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/users/groups) group.
