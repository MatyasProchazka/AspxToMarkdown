# Notification
   
On this page you can set up automatic notifications about the occurrence and progress of requests. This is the [common setting for all services](../../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services/notifications),
 which is only used if the service does not have [custom notification settings](../service/notification).

Options:
   
- **Notifications to the solver**
- **Notifications to requester**

    For more information on notification types, see [Notifications](../../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services/notifications).

- [Notification styles](notification-style)
