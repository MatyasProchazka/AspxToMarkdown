# Incoming message rules
 
This page is used to manage the rules that the ALVAO Service Desk applies to incoming email messages that have been delivered to [service inboxes](../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services) and based on which new requests have been created.

> [!NOTE]
> 

Individual rules are applied to an incoming message sequentially in the same order as they appear on this page (when sorted by the *Order* column). Each rule consists of a *condition* and an *action*. The action is only executed if the condition is met.   
 Once one of the rules (if more than one is set) is evaluated as true for a message, processing ends, not all are evaluated.
      
Options:
 
- **Commands Panel**
    - **New Rule** - create [new rule](roles-messages/create-roles-messages).
    - **Edit**- edit the selected rule.
    - **Delete** - delete the selected rule.
    - **Down** - move the selected rule down one position.
    - **Up** - move the selected rule up one position.
- **Rules table**- contains all the rules created. The table can be [customize](../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables).
- **Selected Rule** - when you select a rule in the table, [preview](roles-messages/detail) will appear to the right of the table
  with information about the selected rule.
