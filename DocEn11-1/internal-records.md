# Internal records
      
You can enable or disable the display of most events written to the Requester in the request log. This allows you to hide internal communications within the solution team from the requester.  
         To change the visibility of an event, use the [Request](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests/request) - **Communications - Event Menu - ...**- [Edit](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/diary/edit) - **Show to requester** tab.
