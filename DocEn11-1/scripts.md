# Scripts
 
On this page you can manage the scripts of the selected application. Each application consists of one or more C# scripts, each script representing a specific UI element or other type of program extension.
  
Options:

- **Command Panel**
    - [New script](new) - create a new script
    - [Edit](edit) - edit the source code of the selected script
    - **Delete** - permanently remove the selected script
- **Scripts table** - contains all scripts in the selected application and their properties. You can [customize the table as needed](../../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables).
