> [!TIP]
> Use a uniform scale of values across all services, e.g. 5=frequently used knowledge (FAQ), 10=normal knowledge, 15=little used knowledge. This will ensure the correct order of displaying knowledge from different services.

> [!TIP]
> In the title, annotation and text of the knowledge, use words that your users actually search for the knowledge. For search statistics, see [data analysis](../../../../alvao-service-desk/evaluation-of-system-operation/data-analysis) on the *Search* sheet.
