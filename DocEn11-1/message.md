# Message
   
Use this form to [send an email message](../../../../alvao-service-desk/requests/send-message) regarding the selected request. The message will be sent from the request service email address and will be displayed on the [Communications](../request) tab.
    
Options:
   
- **Command Panel**
    - **Send** - send a message
    - **Attachment** - attach an attachment to the message. This command has the same function as the *Add Attachment* button
  in the form.
    - **Message** - if, in the course of writing a message, you decide that you do not want to send the text you have written as a message, but just want to save it to the request log, e.g. as a note or minutes of a personal meeting, select the desired event type from this menu. This will change the form to [Note](note).
    - **Transit to status** - move to another request status according to the [solving process](../request).
- **To** - enter at least part of the message recipient's name, then select that recipient from the drop-down menu. You can also type the recipient's email address directly into the line.
- **Copy** - in the case of a secondary recipient, enter the secondary recipient of the message.
- **Subject**- check and edit the subject of the message.
- **Text**- write the message. You can use the *Knowledge Base* button in the command bar above the input field to insert the text of some knowledge from the Knowledge Base into the message text.
- **Attachments**- list of attachments to the message.
    - **Add Attachment** - select the file you want to add as an attachment. You can also attach files by dragging and dropping them into the form.
- **Display to requester** - turn on if you want the Requester to see the message on the *Communications* tab of the selected request.
- **Wait for response** - turn on if you want to count the time between sending the message and receiving a response from the requester as [waiting for the requester](../../../../alvao-service-desk/requests/wait-for-response). Time is only counted in the *waiting for a requester* if the message is addressed to the requester.
- **Important** - enable this option if there is an important event, such as a request being submitted or clarified. On the [Communications](../request) tab, the event will be highlighted with a blue flag symbol.
- **Request solution** - enable this option if the event contains a description of how to resolve the request. On the [Communications](../request) tab, the event will be highlighted with a green flag symbol.
- **Cost Report** - if applicable, [show the work time](../../../../alvao-service-desk/requests/work-time) spent resolving the request.
