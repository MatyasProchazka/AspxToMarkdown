# Absence

On this page you can schedule your absence from work and choose your [representative](../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/users/deputy).
 
Options:

- **I am or will be absent**- turn on if you plan to be absent from work.
    - **From** - enter the date and time you will be absent from work.
    - **To** - enter the date and time you will be back at work.
- **My substitute**- enter at least part of your representative's name and then select that person from the menu. Your representative must be from the same organisation as you.
- **I am substituting**- the table lists the people you are representing and the dates of their planned absence.
    - **Set person as Out of office (absent)** - if the person has not set their absence and is absent, you can set an absence for them.
