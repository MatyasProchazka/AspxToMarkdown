# Add item
   
This window is used to add an item to the [New Request Form](new-ticket-items).
    
Options:
   
- **Available Items** - In the mouse menu, double-click the request item you want to add to the form, or select the item with the mouse and press OK. Request items that are set up in the [process](../../../../../alvao-webapp/administration/service-desk/process/detail/request-items) of the service being edited are placed at the top of the list. They are followed by all custom request items regardless of the process settings.  

Only items that are not already on the form are displayed in the menu.   
System items that are not set up in the process are not displayed in the menu.
    - **Search** - type part of the name of the item you are searching for. This will only display items in the item menu whose name contains the text you entered.
- **New Item** - create [new custom field](new-ticket-form-new-item).
