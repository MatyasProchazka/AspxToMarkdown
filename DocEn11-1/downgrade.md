# Enable downgrade
      
This is a scenario where the license may cover older versions of products in addition to the main product license.
     
- Go to [License Registry](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/software/license-registry) and locate the license for which you want to enable older versions of the product, and use the **Enable downgrade** command.
- A window will appear in which you select the specific products that the license should also cover, and then press **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> The license covers the main license product (+ package components) as well as all products (and their package components) listed on the tab [Substitute products](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/software/license-registry/edit/edit-license/substitute-products) (license modification).
