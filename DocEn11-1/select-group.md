# Add Membership
 
This window is used to add the user you are editing to a group (or multiple groups) of users.

Options:

- **Search for a group to add membership to** - enter the part of the group name to which you want to add the edited user. Then select the group you are looking for from the drop-down menu. This will add the selected group to the list below the input field. In this way, you can select several groups at a time, or use the [...] button to select several groups from the table at once (you can [customize](../../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables) the contents of the table). Finally, confirm your selection by pressing *OK*.
