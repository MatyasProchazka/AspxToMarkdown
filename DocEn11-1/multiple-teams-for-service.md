# Requester groups
      
The validity of [user roles in a service](../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services/service-roles) may be limited to requests from a specific **group of requesters**. Thus, you can divide the service team into sub-teams, for example, based on the location of the requester. Requests from applicants from different locations are then handled by different resolution teams.           
           
         The roles of the resolution team members and their specification for specific Requester groups are set in **ALVAO WebApp - Administration - Service Desk - Services - Edit - Permissions -**[Add permissions](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/service-desk/service/detail/service-authorization)**- For Requesters from a group**.           
          Example:  
           
         The *IT/Printers/Something is not working for me* service Requesters are divided into the groups "*Prague*" and "*Brno*". The solvers for this service are divided into the groups "*Resitele\_tiskarny\_Praha*" and "*Resitele\_tiskarny\_Brno*". Group "*Resitele\_tiskarny\_Brno*" has the permissions Operator and Solver for applicants from the group "*Pracovnici\_Brno*", the group "*Resitele\_tiskarny\_Praha*" has the permissions Operator and Solver for applicants from the group "*Pracovnici\_Praha*". If a request is created in this service by a user from the "*Pracovnici\_Brno*" group, only users from the "*Resitele\_tiskarny\_Brno*" group are notified and have permission to resolve this request. Unless permissions are set otherwise, users from the group "*Resitele\_tiskarny\_Praha*" do not have access to this request.
