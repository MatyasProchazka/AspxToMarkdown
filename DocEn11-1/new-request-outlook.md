# Loading the request from MS Outlook
      
You can create a new request from a message delivered to your personal mailbox using [Outlook Add-in](../../modules/alvao-outlook-addin) - **New Request from Message**.
      
In the log of requests retrieved in this way, you will find the full text of the retrieved message including attachments.  
         One new request is created for each message. For each request, notifications are sent to the main solver and the Requester of the request. To retrieve a message for an existing request, see [Retrieving a message from a requester from MS Outlook](import-messages-from-outlook)
