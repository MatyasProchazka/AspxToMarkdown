# Retrieving a message from the applicant from MS Outlook
      
In the event that a requester sends an email message to your personal mailbox that contains additional information to an existing request, you can use the [ALVAO Outlook Add-in](../../modules/alvao-outlook-addin) - **Save to Request Log** command to save the message to the request log in Alvao directly from Outlook.

> [!NOTE]
> If the sent message does not have a subject, the placeholder text "(no title)" is used for the request title or "(no subject)" for the request's body message. Quotation marks in placeholder texts are not part of strings.
