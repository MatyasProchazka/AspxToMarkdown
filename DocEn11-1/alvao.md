# Alvao authentication
   
Users for whom you create an account in **WebApp - Administration -**[Users](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/users) can log in to Alvao applications with the username and password you specify. In **WebApp - User Menu -**[Change Password](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/settings/password), they can then change their password themselves. In **WebApp - Administration - Settings -**[Password Policies](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/settings/password-policy), you can possibly modify the password complexity requirements for them.
   
You can also use the [ImportCsv](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/users/authentication/alvao/import-users-csv) utility to bulk load these user accounts into Alvao.
