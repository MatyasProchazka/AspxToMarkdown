# Add link
 
Use this window to edit or create new [links between two licenses](../../alvao-asset-management/software-management/licenses-links).  
 The first license is already pre-populated and cannot be changed (it is the license you are currently editing), so you select the second license and the link you want to connect the two licenses.
 
Options:
 
- **License** - the license currently being edited.
- **Link Type** - select [from the menulink type](../../alvao-asset-management/software-management/licenses-links#link_type).
- **License**- select a license from the menu.
    - [...](software/license-registry) - or select a license from the License Registry.
