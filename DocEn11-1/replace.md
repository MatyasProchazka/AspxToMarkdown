# Replace user companies
 
In this Window, you can replace custom contact records for companies and organizations with certified records. The list of certified companies and organizations is stored in [Software Product Library](../../../../../alvao-asset-management/software-management/custom-swlib) and is updated incrementally. The goal of replacing user companies is to avoid creating duplicate entries in the database.  
 The left table shows the user records and the right table shows the certified records.
 
Options:

- **Replace** - replace the selected user record with the selected certified record.
- **Close** - close the window (without saving changes).
