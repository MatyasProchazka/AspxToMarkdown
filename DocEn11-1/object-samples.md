# Object samples
 
The tab shows a tree containing all the sample objects (you may need to expand some to get to a lower level).

- Select the sample object you want to create. If you select a computer assembly, it will be created including direct descendants.
- Object templates are defined in the [main AM Console window](../../../alvao-asset-management-console),
in the object tree in the *Object Views* folder.
- To confirm your selection, select **OK**. If you have decided to cancel your selection, select **Cancel**.
