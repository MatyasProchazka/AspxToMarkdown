# Replace user-defined products
 
In this Window you can replace user products with certified products. The list of certified software products will be gradually updated and the purpose of replacing user products is to avoid duplicate entries in the database.  
 The left table contains **User Products** and the right table contains **Certified Products from the Software Products Library**.
 
Options:

- **Replace** - Replace the products selected in the user objects with the product selected in the certified products.
- **Close** - do not perform any replacement&lt;/&gt;
