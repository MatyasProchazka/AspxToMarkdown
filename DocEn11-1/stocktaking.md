# Asset check
 
In this window you can edit the data of the selected [inventory](../../../../../modules/alvao-inventory-audits/stocktaking).
 
Options:

- **Creation Date** - enter the date the asset check was created.
- **Close Date** - enter the date the asset check was closed. Once the asset check is closed, it will not be possible to edit the list of inventoried assets.
- **Asset List Locked** - turn on if you no longer want to allow users to add additional assets to the asset check.
- **Description** - add arbitrary notes to the asset check if necessary.
