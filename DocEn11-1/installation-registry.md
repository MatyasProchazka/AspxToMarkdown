# Installation registry
 
The table shows the history of installations and uninstallations of software products. Each type of record is distinguished by an icon:
 
- ![](../InstInst.GIF)Active (valid) product installation
- ![](../InstUninst.GIF)Uninstalled product

Options:

- [Record installation](installation-registry/record-installation) - write new product installation records.
- **Uninstall** - uninstall selected installation records to uninstall records.
- [Edit](installation-registry/alter-installation) - edit selected record data.
- [Delete](installation-registry/record-uninstallation)
 - permanently delete the selected records.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to show only the current valid installations in the installation list and you are not interested in the history, set the filter in the **Active** to *"Yes"*.
