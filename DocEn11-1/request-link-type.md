# Types of links between requests
      
The types of links between requests are defined in the table [TicketRelationType](../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/customization/database#U_dbo.TicketRelationType).
      
Only adding new custom link types (TicketRelationTypeBehaviorId = 1) is supported. Other links are system links, do not change their entries or remove them.
