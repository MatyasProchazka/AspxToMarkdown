# Consumables warehouse
      
A warehouse of objects of the same type ("consumables warehouse") can be created from any object. In order to use an object as a consumables warehouse, it must contain the "Quantity" property. It is then possible to invoke the *Change Quantity...* command from the local menu in the object tree to invoke the [Change Quantity](../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/change-quantity) window, where you can perform receive/receive operations.
