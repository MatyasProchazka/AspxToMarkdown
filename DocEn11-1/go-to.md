# Go to
 
Using the Go menu, it is easier to navigate in the [tree](object-tree) - i.e. in the object hierarchy.
 
Options:

- **Back** - select the object that was selected before the currently selected object.
- **Next** - select an object that was selected before the **Back** option was used.
- **Level Up** - selecting an object that is higher in the tree than the selected object.
- **To the parent object** - move to the parent [object of the selected property](../../alvao-asset-management/objects-and-properties). The parent object is selected in the object tree and the property is selected on the **Properties** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> This option is only available if a property is selected that is inherited from a parent object.  

 The *parent object* is the object with the original property. It is the first occurrence of the property from which child objects inherit the property. The property can be modified at this point.
