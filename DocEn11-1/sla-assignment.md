# SLA assignment
     
In this form, assign a certain [SLA](../../../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services/sla) to a user or group for the service being modified.
     
Options:
     
- **SLA** - select SLA from the menu.
- **Select person or group** - enter at least part of the user or group name and select the user or group from the drop-down menu. This will add the selected user or group to the list below the input field. You can then select several users and groups in turn, or use the [...] button to select several items from the table at once (you can [customize](../../../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables) the contents of the table).
- **Default SLA** - check this option to make this SLA the default for the users, groups, and the service. When a new request is submitted through the [New request](../../../../requests/new-request) form, the form is populated with the default SLA for the given requester and service. In case there are multiple default SLAs the one with the highest [Quality index](../../sla/create-sla) is chosen.
