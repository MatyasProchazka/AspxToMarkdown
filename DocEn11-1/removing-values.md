# Removing values
      
Items in tables can be deleted in several ways, and only some of them can be supported at different places in the program.
     
1. Menu: **Edit - Delete**
2. Context menu: right-click on an item to open the context menu and select the **Delete** or **Table - Delete** command from it.
3. Use the Delete key.

> [!NOTE]
> In ServiceDesk, some tables allow deleted items to be recreated. You must first display the deleted items in the table using the **Show - Deleted** command. Then select the items you want to restore and use the **Edit - Restore Deleted** command. The administrator can delete items already deleted, this will cause a **definitive deletion** of the item (irreversible).
