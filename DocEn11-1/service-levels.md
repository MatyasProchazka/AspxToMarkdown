# Service levels
      Define simple levels of requests resolution and within them key performance indicators (KPIs):         
- Time To React (TTR)
- Time To Close (TTC)

     These KPIs are measured and reported.  
     
A claim may, of course, be reclassified between the levels that a particular claimant is eligible to claim after the initial analysis and at any later time as new circumstances are identified. In the case of providing services to external claimants (outsourcing), we may price the different levels.
