# Log
    
On this tab, you will find the log of the selected object.
    
Options:
   
- **Command Panel**
    - **Open Attachment** - open or download the attachment of the selected journal entry. If the record has multiple attachments, select the attachment you want to open in the menu that appears.
- **Log table** - contains the log entries of the selected object. You can [customize](../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables) the table as needed.
  Unlike the AM Console, the table does not display requests and documents, nor can you view deleted records.
