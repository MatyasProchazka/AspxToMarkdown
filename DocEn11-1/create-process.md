# New process
 
This window is used to create a new [process](../../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services/processes).
 
Options:

- **Name** - enter the name of the process. 

> [!TIP]
> We recommend naming processes with the name of the process entity (in singular) that the process handles, e.g. "*Incident*",

  "*Change Request*", etc. The process names are displayed to users in the titles of the *New Request* and *Edit*(request) windows.
- **Description** - enter a description of the process.
- **Influence on the health of objects** - select how requests in services with this process affect the [health](../../../../../modules/alvao-configuration-management/object-health) of objects that are linked to the requests. The option is only available if the [ALVAO Configuration management](../../../../../modules/alvao-configuration-management) module is activated.
