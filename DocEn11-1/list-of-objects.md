# List of objects
  
In this Window you will find [list of objects](../../../alvao-asset-management/searching/list-of-objects). Each view represents one list. You can create an object list on the [Objects](../tab-view/objects) tab by using the *Show in object lists* command.
 
The window options are the same as in the [Found Objects](search-results) window.
