# Backup settings
 
On this page you can create a backup of your personal settings and restore your settings from the backup. Personal settings include settings for [tables](../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables) (views, displayed columns, filters, record sorting, ...) and other options in applications. Personal settings are always backed up and restored as a whole for all Alvao applications at once.
 
Options:

- **Create Settings Backup** - create a backup of your personal settings. You can only have one backup, i.e. creating a new backup will overwrite the previous one.
- **Restore settings from backup** - restore your personal settings from a saved backup.
- **Restore Default Settings** - restores your personal settings to the default as when you first used the apps.
