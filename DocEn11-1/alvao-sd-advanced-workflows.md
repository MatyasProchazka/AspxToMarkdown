# ALVAO Advanced Workflows
     
This extension module can automatically create linked (e.g. child) requests when a new request is created or when a request transitions to a certain status. Set up the functionality in **WebApp - Administration - Service Desk - Processes - Edit - Solving process - &lt;New/edit specific state&gt;** - [Behavior](../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/service-desk/process/detail/status-request/behavior) -**Automatic Request Creation**.
     
Next, in **WebApp - Administration - Service Desk - Processes - Edit - Solving process - &lt;New/edit specific state&gt;** - [Behavior](../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/service-desk/process/detail/status-request/behavior) -   **Assign request to a solver group during transition to this status**, you can set the request to be automatically forwarded to the preconfigured resolution group when the request enters that process status.
