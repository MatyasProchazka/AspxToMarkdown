# Important communication
     
To make it easier to navigate the request communication, the initiation message containing the request is marked with a "flag" icon and the resolution message is marked with a "pipe" icon. Other events in the communication can be flagged in the same way, either immediately when they are created or subsequently when they are edited with the *Edit* command. You can also deselect them afterwards.
     
You can also mark events directly on the *Communications* tab with the *Mark with Important* or *Mark with Request Resolution* flags, or by clicking on the icons below the event author's portrait.

> [!NOTE]
> Only those events in the communication that can be edited can be marked. Only members of the service's solution team can change the label.
