# Software Profile Exceptions for this computer
 
This window allows you to set exceptions to predefined [Software Profile](../../../../alvao-asset-management/software-management/software-profiles) on the computer currently being modified.  
 The exceptions that already exist for the computer are shown in the table. Exceptions always have a higher priority than definitions originating from the profile.  
 It is possible to add and remove products and set different profile settings for them - *optional*, *mandatory* *disabled*.
 
Options:

- [Add](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/software/products) - add the products you want to set an exception for.
- **Remove** - remove selected products from the exceptions list.

Local menu options:

- **Optional** - set selected products as optional.
- **Mandatory** - setting selected products as mandatory.
- **Disabled** - setting selected products as disabled.

Note:
In [the main AM Console window](../../../alvao-asset-management-console) on the **Software** then shows the difference against the SW profile and exceptions for specific computers.
