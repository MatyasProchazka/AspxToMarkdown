# Software Management
      
Alvao supports three levels of software management that can be combined:
     
- [Product status](software-management/product-state) - product lifecycle management
- [Software license audit](software-management/licenses-software-audit) - monitoring license purity in the organization
- [Software profiles](software-management/software-profiles) - identifying permitted and non-permitted software on specific computers
