# Organization
      
Organization is used to organize users (persons) by company. This functionality is particularly important when the service desk provides services to external customers from different companies.
     
You can manage organizations in **WebApp - Administration -**[Organizations](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/organization).
      
When editing a user (*WebApp - Administration - Users -*[Edit Properties](../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/users/detail/edit)), you can then select from the defined organizations in the **Organization** field. Each user can be in at most one organization.
     
You can create [custom fields](../custom-items) for organizations.
