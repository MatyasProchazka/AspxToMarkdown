# Detection method
   
This tab allows you to select the [detection method](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/detection) and, if necessary, specify other settings for the selected method.
   
Options:
   
- **Detection method** - select how you want to detect the computer from the menu. Detection methods and how to select a detection method are described [here](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/detection/detection-way).
- **Agent Port Number** - Enter the port number for TCP/IP data communication with the agent if you are using detection: **Agent over TCP/IP**.

> [!TIP]
> In administration, you set a global detection setting that will detect all computers by default.  

  In the Asset Management Console, you can set custom detection settings for specific computers and change the detection method there.
