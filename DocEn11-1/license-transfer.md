# Move licence

This function is used to move selected licenses to another computer or user, or to another cost center.

- **Move licenses to a computer/user**  

 When moving multiple licenses of different types in bulk, only licenses of the "per computer" type will be moved.
- **Move licenses to cost centre** -
 select a cost centre from the menu, or enter a new cost centre under which the licences will be moved. A quick search can be used in the menu.

> [!NOTE]
> When moving to another computer/user or cost center, any underlying licenses that have been upgraded by the moving licenses will also be moved.
