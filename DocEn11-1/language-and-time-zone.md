# Languages and time zone
     
On this page, you can specify which languages users can choose their [preferred language](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/settings/language) from, and in which time zone they want to see time data by default. In a [multi-language environment](../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/multi-languages), you can translate some settings items into other languages here.
      
Options:
     
- **Command Panel**
    - **Download translation workbook** - download an MS Excel file with phrases for translation when used in a [multi-language environment](../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/multi-languages).
    - **Upload translations** - upload the translated file to Alvao.
- **Alvao System Language** - basic [Alvao system language](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/supported-languages). This language must be selected during the initial installation of Alvao and cannot be changed later.
- **Additional Languages in the Preferred Language Selection Menu** - a list of additional languages that are displayed to users in the menu for selecting their [preferred language](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/settings/language), and into which you may want to translate some [setting items](../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/multi-languages).
    - **Add language** - [add](add-language) another language to the list.
- **Default time zone**- the default time zone in which time data is displayed to users in the application.
    - **Edit** - change the time zone.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, each user can [select their time zone](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/settings/language). Also, each [service](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/service-desk/service/create-service) in the service catalog can have its time zone set.
