# Discarded asset registry
     
There is a special folder in the object tree called *Disposed assets* for the accounting of discarded assets. This folder is used to keep track of discarded assets, i.e. assets that were previously used in the company but have now been physically disposed of. It is not a warehouse of assets to be scrapped.
