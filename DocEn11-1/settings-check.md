# Configuration check
 
On this page you can see a list of detected deficiencies in the Alvao settings.
 
If you are an [administrator](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/users/groups) or [Settings Manager](../../../../alvao-asset-management/implementation/users/groups) and when the automatic settings check, which is performed once/day, detects deficiencies, you will see a [warning](../../../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp) icon in the upper right corner of the app. You will also receive an email notification.
