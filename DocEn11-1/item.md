# License item
 
In this Window, you can edit the license item - that is, the computer or user to whom the license is assigned and other details about that assignment.
 
Options:

- **Computer/User** - select from the list the computer or user to which you want to assign the license. Alternatively, use **...** select in a new window
 [Computers](../../../license-and-install-overview/actions/computers) or [Users](../../../license-and-install-overview/actions/users).  

Notes:

    - If you are adding new entries, you can also select multiple computers/users at once. Only one item can be edited.
    - Only computers/users that have not yet been assigned a license are offered.
    - If you change the computer of an existing license item, this change will be propagated throughout the upgrade history, i.e. also to the items to which this license is linked.
- **Number of licenses assigned**- Enter the number of licenses you want to assign to the selected computer. This field is displayed only for kernel licenses.

> [!TIP]
> The number of physical cores of the selected computer is listed under the Computer field.

- **Activation Key** - Enter the license activation key.   
If you are assigning an MSDN license to a user, enter the MSDN ID number here. 

> [!CAUTION]
> This value will be stored in the database in unencrypted form!

- **Cost Center** - eventually select or type [cost center](../../../license-and-install-overview/view) for which the license item is intended. 

Notes:

    - If you do not enter any value, the license will be available for all cost centres.
    - If you change the cost centre for an existing license item, the change will be propagated throughout the upgrade history, including to items to which the license is linked.
- **Inventory Number** - specify the inventory number under which this license item will be recorded in the accounting system.
- **Request** - a number or other reference to a request related to the license request item can be entered, e.g. purchase request, etc.
- **Note** - write a note on the license item.
- **Enter next item** - turn on if you want to enter another license item. (This option is only available if you are writing a new license item.)

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not enter a *"serial number"*, *"center"* or *"inventory number"*, the corresponding value specified in the license is automatically used.
