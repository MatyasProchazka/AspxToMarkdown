# Grouping
      
The grouping feature is useful if you want to see rows grouped by certain criteria.  
         If you want to see a list of items grouped by a specific column, right-click on the header of that column and select **Group** from the menu.  
         A tree will appear to the left of the table. At the root of the tree will be the "All" item, and below it will be listed the individual column values on the basis of which the grouping was performed. If you select a value, the table will only show the entries that contain it in that column.  
         You can use the **New Tree** command to create another tree for grouping by another column. If at least two trees are created, tabs for switching trees are displayed in the table header.
