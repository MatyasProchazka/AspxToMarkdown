# Searching, reporting and data analysis
      
The system offers several ways of information retrieval, reporting and data analysis.
     
You can search and analyze data in a consistent way in most of the tables that appear in Alvao applications, see [Working with tables](../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables). If you need to perform more complex analyses or simply create charts and reports, use MS Excel, to which the contents of tables can be easily exported using the **Analyze in Excel** command.
     
In particular, the following tables can be used for requests analysis:
     
- [Requests](../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests/table-of-requests)
- [Log](../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/diary)
