# Object Security - Permissions
 
The window allows you to set user permissions to [object](../../../../../alvao-asset-management/objects-and-properties). Objects are managed in [ALVAO Asset Management](../../../../../alvao-asset-management).
 
Options:

- **User/group** - select the user or group for which you want to set permissions.
- [Object](securityobject-authorization/select-object) - select a specific object. The permissions you set will be limited to the selected object and possibly all its child objects.
- **Including child objects** - enable if you want to set permissions for [child objects](../../../../../alvao-asset-management/glossary) of the selected object.
- **Objects of the kind** - select from the list the [type of object](../../../../../alvao-asset-management/objects-and-properties) for which you want to set permissions.
- **Permissions** - see [Object security](../../../../../alvao-asset-management/objects-and-properties/object-access-rights).
