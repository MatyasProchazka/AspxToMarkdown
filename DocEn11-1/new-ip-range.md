# IP address range
 
Use this window to create or edit a range of IP addresses of computers for which integrated user authentication will be enabled when logging into the ALVAO WebApp.
 
Options:

- **From** - enter the first (starting) address of the range.
- **To** - enter the last (end) address of the range.
- **One IP address** - enable if you do not want to specify a range, but only one specific IP address. This will display the **IP address** field instead of the *From* and *To* fields.
