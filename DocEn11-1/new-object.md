# New object
   
In this window, select the sample object you want to create a new object based on in the object tree.
   
Options:
   
- **Search** - if you know the name of the sample object, type at least part of it and press *Enter*. Under the input line, the relevant tree components will expand and the found objects will be highlighted in yellow.
- **Object samples/Object templates** - use the "+" button to expand the object menu, select the object you want to use as a pattern and press the **OK** button. If you select an object of type *Assembly* that contains child objects, the object will be copied including the child objects at the first level. For other object types, child objects are not copied.
