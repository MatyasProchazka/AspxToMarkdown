# Identity Management
      
We consider Microsoft Active Directory to be the correct system for storing information related to user accounts, computer accounts, and servers. We also consider Microsoft Active Directory to be the correct system to handle all access rights and authentication: Single Sign-On (SSO).
     
In conjunction with ALVAO Service Desk, you get a comprehensive system for managing the creation, modification and cancellation of access and accounts. This can also be done by using common processes to manage Employee Onboarding and Employee Offboarding.
     
The system can also be extended so that accounts are automatically created in Microsoft Active Directory upon approval.
