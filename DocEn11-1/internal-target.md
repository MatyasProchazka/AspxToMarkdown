# Setting internal request deadlines
      
You can use the **Internal Goal** request item to meet important internal deadlines during request resolution. To set the internal goal of a request, use **Requests** - [Edit](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests/request/edit) - **Internal Goal**.

> [!TIP]
> In the requests table, view the columns *Current Target*, *Current Goal (deadline)* and *Current Goal (hours remaining)* by which requests can be sorted and filtered. 

> [!NOTE]
> The *Internal Target* item must be enabled in the service process as [request item](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/administration/service-desk/process/detail/request-items).
