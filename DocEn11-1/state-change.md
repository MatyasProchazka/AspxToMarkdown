# Status change
     
After completing a task within a request status, the solver moves the request further within the defined workflow using [Request](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests)y - **Go to status** or **Edit - Request status**. You cannot change the status of a request while approval is in progress.
     
When changing the status, the user is prompted to fill in the required items for that status. The mandatory items and solving process can be set on the [Processes](../implementation/services/processes) page.

> [!TIP]
> You can also easily change the status of a request in the [Request](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests/request) - *Solution Progress* tab by clicking on the appropriate "thermometer" cell near the left edge of the tab.
