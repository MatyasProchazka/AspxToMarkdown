# ALVAO Configuration Management
     
The module allows you to create [links](../alvao-asset-management) between objects in [ALVAO Asset Management](alvao-configuration-management/object-links), representing Configuration Items (CI), to draw diagrams of these links and to perform e.g. impact analysis on failures and changes to configuration items. In conjunction with [ALVAO Service Desk](../alvao-service-desk), the module allows you to automatically evaluate [object health](alvao-configuration-management/object-health).
