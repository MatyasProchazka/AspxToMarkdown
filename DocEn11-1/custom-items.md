# Custom fields
 
This page is used to manage [custom fields](../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/custom-items).
  
Options:

- **Command Panel**
    - **New custom field** -
   Add [new field](custom-items/create-custom-item).
    - **Edit** -
   edit the selected field. The menu contains the same commands as the blocks in the [field preview](custom-items/detail).
    - **Delete** - delete selected fields.
- **Custom fields table** - the table contains views for each entity (Request, Service, SLA, ...) that show the custom fields of the entity. You can [customize the table as needed](../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables).
- **Selected field** - when you select an field in the table, a [preview](custom-items/detail) will appear to the right of the table
  with information about the selected field.  In each preview block, the *Edit* command is displayed to edit that block.
