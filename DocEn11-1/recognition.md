# Send SW for identification - step 1 of 3

The recognition feature allows you to send unrecognized registry entries to our [Software Product Library](../../../../alvao-asset-management/software-management/custom-swlib). The recognized product will be added to the library.

- **Don't show this page next time** - turn this on if you don't want to show this splash page in the future and want to show straight [step 2](recognition/send-to-recognition-2).

> [!NOTE]
> It is also possible to enable the automatic sending of unrecognized records in the Collector settings in **ALVAO WebApp â€“ Administration - Asset Management - Servers - Edit Server - Properties**

 - [Software Products Library](../../../alvao-webapp/administration/asset-management/servers/detail/edit) section.
