# Add member
 
Use this window to add users and groups to [groups](../create-group).
  
Options:
 
- **Search for a person or group to add** - enter at least part of the user name or group name and select the user or group from the drop-down menu. This will add the selected user or group to the list below the input field. You can then select several users and groups at a time, or use the [...] button to select several items from the table at once (you can [customize the table contents](../../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables)). Finally, confirm the selection with the *OK* button.
