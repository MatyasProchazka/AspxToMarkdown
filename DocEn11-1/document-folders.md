    - **Edit**
        - **Properties** - edit the basic attributes of the folder.
        - **Security** - edit access permissions to documents in the folder.
    - **Delete** - permanently delete a document folder including all set permissions.
- **Document Folders Table** - contains all document folders and their selected attributes. You can [customize the table as needed](../../../../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables).
