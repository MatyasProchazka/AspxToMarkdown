# Width and visibility of columns
     
Adjust the width of each column by grabbing the right edge of its header with the mouse and moving it to the right or left.  
         To hide a column, left click in its header and select **Hide this column** from the menu.  
           
         To display the column again:

1. In the header, right click and select **Show Columns** from the menu.  

> [!NOTE]
> In ALVAO WebApp, you can find this command in the view menu (**...**) or in the local menu on the column header.

2. A window will open on the screen to select the columns to be displayed in the table.

         In desktop applications, a hidden column in the table header can be expanded to show it again. You need to grab the left edge of the next column in the header with your mouse and move it to the right.
