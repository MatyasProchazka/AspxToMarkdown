# SLA assignment
    
The form is used to allocate [SLA](../../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services/sla)   for selected [services](../../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services)   to users.  Users with an SLA assigned to a service have the [requester](../../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services/service-roles) role in that service.
    
- **SLA** - select the SLA that you want to allow the user (group) to use in the selected services.
- **Select services...** - check the services you want to assign the SLA to.
- **Default SLA** - check this option to make the SLA the [default](../../service-desk/service/detail/sla-assignment) for the users (groups) and the selected services.
