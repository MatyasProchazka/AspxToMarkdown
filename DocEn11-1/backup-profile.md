# Backup and restore table settings
     
You can restore table settings (views, filters, ...) to their default state. Alternatively, you can create a backup of your settings in case you accidentally change your settings in the future and want to revert to the saved backup.
     
You can perform these operations in the following places in the applications:
     
- **ALVAO WebApp - User Menu - Settings** - [Settings Backup](../../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/settings/settings-backup)
- **ALVAO Asset Management Console - Tools - Settings** - tab [Backup settings](../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/tools/settings/restore)
