     TODO - 134500 - Po přenesení pod ALVAO Microsoft Endpoint Manager Connector odstranit.     
This module enables the detection of hardware and software computers read from Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (MS SCCM).   This eliminates the need to install agents on the target computers, nor is it necessary to set user permissions to access WMI, remote registry, and hard drives.
     
This is a special detection method that only requires Collector running and access to the Administration Service or directly to the MS SCCM database.
